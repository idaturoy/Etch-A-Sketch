# Etch-A-Sketch
Start drawing like on the etch-a-sketch toys you had as a child!
You can choose between tuttifrutti color and default green, and you have the option to make the color gradient. To choose the grid size, type the number of rows/columns you would like and click enter. 

FYI
The app works best on computer device, regards responsivness and functionality.
If you have any ideas for how I can improve it, please, hit me up!
